        title: The North Wales Way
        description: Stretching along the northern reaches of Wales, the North Wales Way makes for an inspired road trip. Start by driving through the pretty Clwydian hills before stopping at historic Ruthin, and on to the long crescent beach of Colwyn Bay. Hop between bustling Llandudno and Conwy, where an imposing fortress marks one of many dramatic castles you’ll spot. Bangor, Caernarfon and Beaumaris follow, before the trail ends at Holy Island, just off Anglesey.

        title: Cliff Camping, Cliff Climbing
        description: The Welsh sure know how to live life on the edge. Whether it’s hanging off the edge or jumping off the edge, either is truly daring. Spend the night in a tent suspended down steep cliff sides, with the ocean roaring beneath. Or, throw caution to the wind and launch yourself into the bitter sea, on a guided coasteering day for unrivalled fun. Both unique experiences are, naturally, available here in Wales.
