        description: There are countless places to eat in London (throw a stone and you’ll hit one), but among them are restaurants pioneering a trend of sustainability and community-building. One of the best is the Clink Restaurant in Brixton Prison - a charity that aims to rehabilitate prisoners by training them as chefs - book in for a fine-dining experience like no other; one that truly gives something back. Next, try Jamie Oliver’s flagship Fifteen restaurant, an organisation aimed at giving unemployed young people the start they need in the food industry, with a menu that uses local-produce to create mouth-wateringly good 5-course meals.

        description: The industrial heritage of Birmingham is brought to life in the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley, an open-air recreation of an early 20th century village. Telling the tale of the Industrial Revolution, of which Dudley played a central role, the museum is staffed by a host of characters in period costume who’ll take you back in time. There’s a coal mine, a school, a fairground, a pub, a chippy, and a whole village of retro houses and shops to explore. It’s a nostalgia trip that’s yet to be surpassed.

        description: Dive deep into the bracing waters of Larrybane Bay and swim across to the dramatic island of Carrick-a-Rede. Passing under the famous rope-bridge that connects the island to the mainland, this 1km swim is as visually compelling as it is challenging, with grass-topped cliffs, coastal caves and and rocky outcrops to see on your crawl to the other side. Celebrate afterwards with a sea-view picnic, before heading to the seaside village of Cushendun. Here you’ll find Mary McBride’s, one of Ireland’s smallest pubs, a traditional establishment stocking a wide range of Irish Whiskeys, a cosy atmosphere and some jolly good craic!

Take a sponsored walk with the Guide Over Sands Trust, a charity providing guides for a safe passage over the estuary - a means of experiencing the Bay’s spectacular sand-spread vistas while raising money for a worthy cause.

Starting in north-east Wales, navigate the twists and turns of the waterway before floating into the Shropshire countryside, making sure, of course, to pitstop at the various pubs on the way - ideal for a small group of friends. The highlight of the trip will undoubtedly be the “stream in the sky”, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, a bridge over the River Dee that soars at around 126ft. Expect some truly epic views (and a hit of adrenaline) as you pass across to the other side...

As the sun begins to set over the heather moorlands, take a hike to one of the park’s star discovery sites - the Hawes centre, Malham centre, the Buckden car park, or the Tan Hill Inn, otherwise known as the ‘highest pub in Britain’ - where the high-altitude, open landscapes provide spine-tingling panoramic views of the Northern Hemisphere. On a clear night, you might even catch a glimpse of the Milky Way...
