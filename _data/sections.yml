        id: munro-bagging
        description: In case you didn’t know, a “munro” is a Scottish mountain with a height of over 3,000 feet - if you manage to reach the summit, you might say you’ve “bagged it”, and for good reason, too. From the formidable boulder fields of Schiehallion to the sweeping landscapes and high altitudes of Ben Chonzie, Buachaille Etive Mor and Mount Keen, the 282 munros of Scotland are as physically challenging as they are beautiful.

        id: coasteering
        description: Along the wild, craggy coastline of East Lothian hides an adrenaline fuelled adventure. Coasteering is one of those sports that seems to defy reason; see a cliff, jump off it. Feel the rush as you plunge through the salty spray into the cool water before climbing up the rocks to do it all again – and although it feels unnatural, it is certainly a thrill. Head for Coast to Coast Surf School to try your hand at this wild practice.

        description: An unlikely fusion of go-karting and sailing, ‘land yachting’ is a popular fixture of St Andrews’ West Sands in The Kingdom of Fife. With the sea-breeze as your motor, speed along this lengthy stretch of beach; race against your friends or just take it for a spin and discover the beauty of the coast. Other activities here include surfing, kayaking and ‘zapcatting’ - a means of shooting across the water on high-speed catamarans.

        description: On the edge of the River Tay, the recently opened V&A in Dundee is a feat of modern architecture, with curving concrete walls reminiscent of a Scottish cliff face.

        description: Often regarded as one of the most spectacular prehistoric sites in Western Europe, the Neolithic village of Skara Brae provides a vivid picture of life lived around 5,000 years ago. Found on the Mainland, the largest island of the Orkney archipelago, these ancient homes are fitted with beds of stone, and even dressers, while an array of tools and artefacts can be seen at the nearby Visitor’s Centre - a fascinating, and deeply moving testament to human achievement.

With an eclectic mix of Celtic, world and roots music, expect a riotous three days of singing, dancing, drinking and storytelling. Being a family festival at heart, there’s also a children’s marquee and procession, as well as puppet shows, fire shows, and an array of delicious world cuisine.

        description: The ancestral home of the world-renowned poet and novelist, Sir Walter Scott, offers a beguiling insight into the mind of the man himself. Located on the stunning banks of the River Tweed in the Scottish Borders, Abbotsford House tells the tale of Scott’s tumultuous life, while offering visitors a glimpse into the tastes and preoccupations of the Romantic movement of which he was a part. For the full literary experience, however, there’s also the option of staying the night in the Hope Scott Wing - a chance to experience some 19th century hospitality, as one of Walter Scott’s distinguished guests.

The Solway Coast is a beachcomber’s haven with an array of shell beaches, and for avid star gazers, there is The Galloway Forest Park. Due to its sparse population and lack of light pollution, it was named the country’s first Dark Sky Park.

Here you’ll find a slower pace of life exploring rugged coast and countryside and observing stunning wildlife and fauna – walk or cycle the Hebridean Way and your reward will be the picturesque lighthouse at the Butt of Lewis. There are also prehistoric gems such as The Calanais Standing Stones on the Isle of Lewis. In the towns, however, you’ll hear Gaelic being spoken by the locals and traditional folk music been played in the pubs.
